# Heart Attack Risk Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis tool for predicting heart attack risks based on various health indicators. Utilizing a powerful backend developed with Flask, the application processes and analyzes health data, while the React-based frontend offers an intuitive interface for data input, analysis, and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Input**: Allows users to input individual health data for analysis.
- **Risk Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning models to predict heart attack risks based on input data.
- **Data Visualization**: Offers various data visualization tools to understand risk factors better.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- Flask (for the backend)
- React (for the frontend)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-attack-risk-analysis.git
    cd heart-attack-risk-analysis
    ```

2. **Set Up the Backend**

    Navigate to the backend directory and install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Start the Flask server:

    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend**

    Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary npm packages:

    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

    Start the React development server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

### Usage

- Use the frontend interface to input health data for analysis.
- View risk predictions and related health insights based on the provided data.
- Explore various data visualizations to understand the impact of different health indicators on heart attack risk.

## Running the Tests

### Backend Tests

Navigate to the backend directory and execute:

```sh
python -m unittest
Frontend Tests
Navigate to the frontend directory and execute:

sh
Copy code
npm test
Deployment
Consider containerizing the application with Docker or deploying it to a cloud service like AWS, GCP, or Azure for production environments.
